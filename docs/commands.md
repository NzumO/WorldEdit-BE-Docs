# Commands

Commands are the main way to use the many features of WorldEdit. Type `;help` to get a list of available commands.

You may also refer to the original mod's [documentation](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/commands) on some of the commands, although mind you, there are [differences](differences.md).
