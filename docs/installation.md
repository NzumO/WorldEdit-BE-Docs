# Installation

[TOC]

## Requirements

WorldEdit: BE is an addon that's compatible with Minecraft 1.18.10 on Windows, Android, iOS and XBox. You can also install this addon on server hosting sites such as Aternos, allowing you to join worlds with this addon on any platform that Minecraft is available on. You can use this on both singleplayer and multiplayer games.

!!! note

    The addon **does not** run on Minecraft: Java Edition.

## Installation Step-by-Step

### Locally

Once you've downloaded the addon, simply open it with Minecraft to get it imported.

!!! note
    
    Android users may need a file explorer that allows opening the addon with Minecraft. CX File Explorer is recommended and can be found on the Google Play Store.

If you have the same, or later version of the addon already imported, you may need to delete both the behaviour and resource pack in `Settings > Storage`. In a new world, or an already existing one, add "WorldEdit [BP]" in `Behaviour Packs` and "WorldEdit [RP]" in `Resource Packs`. Also enable "Holiday Creator Features" and "Enable GameTest Framework" in `Experimental Features`. Create/Enter the world, and you're ready to use WorldEdit!

### Aternos Server

To properly add this addon to the server, you first need to upload an already existing world with the experimental features enabled as instructed in the [previous section](#installation-step-by-step).

!!! tip

    It's best if you don't apply the addon to this world before exporting it from Minecraft.

You must then install the addon separately in the server's `packs` folder. Now you can just start the server!

## Uninstalling from a world

It's a straight forward process when deactivating the resource pack, but since this addon uses scripts, Minecraft won't allow you to just deactivate the behaviour pack. You need to delete as shown.
